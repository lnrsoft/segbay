Ebay Auto Bid
=============

Ebay Auto Bid allows bids scheduled on ebay auctions to be executed at a
specific time (i.e. shortly before an auction ends). The applicaiton runs fine
in the Ebay sandbox. 

To get an API key that will work on real live auctions (non-sandbox Ebay), a
fully featured website must be built that demonstrates functionallity not
readily available on ebay.com. Then Ebay may grant a production key that allows
this app to programatically place bids.

This is mostly a proof-of-concept.
