Check Item.AutoPay, if true immediate payment is required, and can't bid on it. See http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/shopping/docs/CallRef/GetSingleItem.html.
- Maps are not safe for concurrent use: it's not defined what happens when you
  read and write to them simultaneously. If you need to read from and write to
a map from concurrently executing goroutines, the accesses must be mediated by
some kind of synchronization mechanism. One common way to protect maps is with
sync.RWMutex.
